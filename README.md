# Powercut

Recently in Zambia, we've experienced load shedding, currently at stage 1, resulting in 8 hours per day without electricity across various areas. It can be challenging to anticipate these power outages, making it difficult to plan ahead for activities such as ironing your clothes. This project is designed to provide clear visibility into the load shedding schedule, helping you understand and plan for these outages more easily.
